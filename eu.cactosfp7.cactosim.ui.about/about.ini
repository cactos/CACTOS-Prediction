aboutText=CactoSim plays the role of a context-aware decision-support tool for data centre management. Data centre operators are able to retrieve up-to-date automatically created models of heterogeneous hardware and virtual landscape components from the Runtime Model Storage provided by CactoScale. By using CactoSim, these obtained real system models then can be manually edited further in order to validate and evaluate optimisation algorithms via what-if-analyses basing results on such metrics as cost and risk. Produced results, in the form of simulated predictions, are derived from collected historical system data such as resource utilisation, usage patterns, failure rates and existing optimisation strategies.
